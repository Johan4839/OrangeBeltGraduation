[x] remove dead code
[x] Readability: proper naming of variables
    p -> positionAndDirection
    s -> positionAndDirectionArray
    rs -> roverState
    dd -> direction
    cms -> roverMovementInstruction
    i -> instruction
    c -> instructionElement
    Not sure yet about xx and yy but for now serves its purpose
